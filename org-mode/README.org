* Org-mode Utilities Collection

This repository contains a collection of utilities designed to enhance your Org-mode experience in Emacs. Each utility is designed to solve a specific problem or add functionality to make working with Org-mode more efficient and enjoyable.

** Utilities

*** org-insert-property-link
A utility for quickly inserting predefined links stored in Org-mode property drawers. This tool allows you to maintain a centralized collection of important links within your Org files and insert them efficiently.

For detailed information, installation instructions, and usage guide, see [[./README-org-property-links.org]].

*** org-multiline-property-utils
This package includes a couple of small additions to org-mode for editing multi-line properties within a property drawer.
1. A fill-column function that behaves as expected for fill-column, which, if
   editing a property, will preserve the property name, and add continuation
   lines if necessary. If not inside a property, wrap as usual for org-mode.
2. A new-line function that creates a new line within a property, using a
   continuation line.

For detailed information see: [[./README-org-multiline-property-utils.org]].
